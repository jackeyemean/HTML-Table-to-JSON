## Overview
This browser extension utilizes [Chrome Extension APIs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api) to allow users to scrape HTML tables from web pages and download them as JSON or CSV files. This is a straightforward tool with a bare-bones interface made for extracting and saving data in a structured format without manual copying.
